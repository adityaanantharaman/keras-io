# Training a Conditional GAN using BCE-loss on the MNIST-Dataset
Conditional gans differ from normal dc-gans in that the class of the generated images can
also be controlled. This feature is called controllable generation and is achieved by
training both the discriminator and generator with labeled data as opposed to the
unlabeled data used to train normal dc-gans. The main distinction here, is that the
discriminator in addition to predicting wheather or not the generated image is a real
looking image in general, also checks if it is a real looking image of that particular
class. How the labels are used in the training of the discriminator and generator is
discussed later in the notebook.

## loading and preprocessing the mnist dataset
Make note to include the labels as well here.


```python
(xtr, ytr), (_, _) = mnist.load_data()
xtr = np.expand_dims(xtr, -1)
xtr = xtr / 255.0  # bring the pixel values to the range 0 to 1
xtr = (xtr - 0.5) / 0.5  # bring pixel values to range -1 to 1
print(
    "shape of training images: " + str(xtr.shape), "shape of labels: " + str(ytr.shape)
)

traindata = tf.data.Dataset.from_tensor_slices((xtr, ytr)).batch(64)
```

<div class="k-default-codeblock">
```
shape of training images: (60000, 28, 28, 1) shape of labels: (60000,)

```
</div>
# How the labels play a role :
### Generator :
The generaotor takes in an input noise vector and generates an image. Here, the input
noise vector, and the desired class' one-hot encoding vector are concatenated, and this
is then fed into the generator in order to generate images of that particular class.
### Discriminator
In the discriminator on the other hand, the labels can be inserted into the training
process in multiple ways. Here, we add the label info into the channel-dimension of the
images fed into the discriminator. eg: the black and white mnist images have 1 channel.
The one-hot label vector is tiled into 28x28 shape using 'tf.tile' and concatenated with
the images along the 3rd dimension (channels). After tiling, if the label is of class 2,
then the 2nd channel alone will consist of all ones, while all the other 9 channels
consist of all zeros. This might be hard to grasp at first, but the implementation is
really simple and will help understand the concept better. Thus, a 28x28x1 image is
transformed into a 28x28x11 image in this case where the number of classes is 10.
